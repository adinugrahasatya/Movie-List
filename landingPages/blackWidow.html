      Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger<br>
      when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force<br>
      that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history<br>
      as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before<br>
      she became an Avenger.
